This Thursday from 17:00-20:00 UTC, Shane Emmons will be hacking on Main Street Mission. If you're interested in getting involved, or just want to say hi, stop by #mendicant on IRC. Shane can help you get setup, discuss features or possibly just tell bad jokes. 

You can find Main Street Mission's code [here](https://github.com/MainStMission/food-pantry-manager).

Hope to see you Thursday!
