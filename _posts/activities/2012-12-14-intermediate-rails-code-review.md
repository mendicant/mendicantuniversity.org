On Friday, December 14, [Gregory Brown][gregory] will be offering up one of his
Rails projects for heckling and suggestions for improvement. The goal of this
study session is to allow intermediate and advanced Rails programmers to *learn
by teaching* best practices and conventions. The application itself is simple, 
and Gregory does not have much web development experience. So even advanced 
beginners should be able to help contribute some suggestions!

To participate, join the [MU community mailing list][list] if you haven't
already, and wait for the discussion to start on December 14. Once it gets
rolling, feel free to share your own thoughts and questions any time between
December 14 and December 21.

Gregory may end up using this Rails application as part of 
a [Practicing Ruby][practicingruby] article, and if he does, you will 
be credited in that article for any suggestions that end up being applied 
to the project.

Hope to see you participate, and happy hacking!
