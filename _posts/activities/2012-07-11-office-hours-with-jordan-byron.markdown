Come one come all on a rip roaring good time with me, your gracious host, [Jordan Byron](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Jordan-Byron), as we dive deep into all your frontend web development questions. When does this fantastic voyage cast off you ask? We ride Wednesday, July 11 between 17:00 and 21:00 UTC.

During office hours everyone in the community is encouraged to stop by and ask questions or pitch in. We can work on technical challenges, discuss new ideas or create your first pull request.

If you are interested in holding your own office hours, fork [mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org), create an activity and submit a pull request.
