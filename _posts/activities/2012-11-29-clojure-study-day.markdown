On Thursday November 29, [Gregory Brown][gregory] will be hosting an an 
email-based [Clojure][clojure] study day. Throughout the day, all who are interested 
in studying Clojure or helping others learn it are welcome to post messages to 
the [MU community mailing list][list] with the subject tag "Clojure Day".

There has already been [some discussion][archives] on what folks plan to share,
but any contribution is welcome! If you've read a great tutorial, it can be as
easy as sending us a link with a short description of why you liked it. Code
reviews are also encouraged: just post a gist for us to look at.

Most of us are Clojure newbies, but we welcome people of all skill
levels.If you have questions about this event, please ask them on the mailing
list. 

Hope to see you participate, and happy hacking!
