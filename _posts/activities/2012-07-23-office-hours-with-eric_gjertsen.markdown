Got a piece of code you want reviewed? Question about how to approach a problem? Stuck on where to begin? I'll be available on Monday, 23 July, from 17:00 - 19:00 UTC. Stop by with your questions and code - all experience levels welcome.

If you are interested in holding your own office hours, fork [mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org), create an activity and submit a pull request. [More instructions here](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/How-to-post-an-activity-to-mendicantuniversity.org).
