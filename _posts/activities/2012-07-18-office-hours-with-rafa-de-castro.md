Hi unicorns!

I'll be holding office hours on Wednesday so you can drop by and have somebody work with you with whatever question you may have. Anyway I'll be probably more useful with Ruby or Java than with cooking or Salsa dancing. You can try anyhow and I'll do my best.

If you are interested in holding your own office hours, fork [mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org), create an activity and submit a pull request. [More instructions here](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/How-to-post-an-activity-to-mendicantuniversity.org).
