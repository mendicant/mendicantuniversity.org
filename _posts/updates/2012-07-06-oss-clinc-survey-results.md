Two weeks ago Shane Emmons [posted a survey](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/06/26/oss-clinic-survey.html) to gather feelings on past and future OSS Clinic offerings. You can now [view the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjkBKEXbo6n8dGpHems3WXNOWlZtYXFpMXVvWHB5OHc) yourself.

The results of this survey were very encouraging. Keep an eye out in the next few weeks for details on an upcoming OSS Clinic featuring Rubinius.
