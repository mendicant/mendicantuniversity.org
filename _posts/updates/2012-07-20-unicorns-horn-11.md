> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

While slow activity-wise, this week was very important for us to talk about our vision and our future as a community. Now is the time for you to step up and share your opinion.

#### What happened this week:

* Gregory Brown wrote an [important essay](http://majesticseacreature.com/essays/2012/07/15/a-new-vision-for-a-new-mendicant.html) where he describes in detail what he believe should be the new vision for Mendicant University and how to bring it back to its true roots. He also [posted it](http://lists.mendicantuniversity.org/pipermail/community-mendicantuniversity.org/Week-of-Mon-20120709/000146.html) on the community list, and while the conversation had a slow start it's building up. To see how the conversation is going you can read the [archives](http://lists.mendicantuniversity.org/pipermail/community-mendicantuniversity.org/Week-of-Mon-20120716/thread.html).

* Eric Gjertsen and Rafa de Castro held office hours this week. Discussions about method delegation in modules, and how to handle validations with a state machine can be reviewed on the [transcript](http://anita.mendicantuniversity.org/mendicant/20120716-18:00..20120717).
