_This week's Unicorn's Horn comes to you from a McDonald's, [deep in the mountains of Virginia](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&cid=11116311971813138899&q=Mc+Donald's&gl=US&hl=en&t=h&z=16&vpsrc=0&iwloc=A)._

> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

#### What happened this week:

* This past Monday a number of Mendicant Community members met over Skype and [discussed how to keep Mendicant moving forward](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/07/06/moving-forward.html). This discussion was spurred after Greg [stepped down](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/32/changing-my-role-in-mendicant) as the driving force behind Mendicant.

* Shane Emmons [concluded the OSS clinic survey](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/06/26/oss-clinic-survey.html) and [published the results](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/07/06/oss-clinc-survey-results.html) for everyone to see. The Survey was very encouraging. Keep an eye out for an OSS Clinic featuring Rubinius in the near future.

* [The forum](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/) saw some activity. faiswulff asked, "[where should I go next](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/37/basic-railsrubyist-where-should-i-go-next)" and what [beginner focused](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/35/beginner-focused) programs mendicant had to offer. rafadc continued the discussion on Beautiful Visualization with [Chapter 1: On Beauty](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/30/beautiful-visualization-chapter-1-on-beauty). Perhaps you could stop by and lend your voice to these discussions.

#### Upcoming Plans:

* Eric Gjertsen is running office hours Monday, July 9 from 14:30 - 16:30 UTC.

* Mendicant Community members are invited to join in on a Skype call Monday, July 9 at 19:00 UTC. During this call we'll discuss the two big philosophical questions. "What are we doing here at Mendicant, and why are we doing it?"

* Brent Vante is planning to run a weekend hackfest in the next two weeks.
