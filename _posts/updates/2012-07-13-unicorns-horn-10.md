> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

Summer is here and so is the 10th issue of "The Unicorn's Horn". We'll try to gather what happend in our community this week and where are we going.

#### What happened this week:

* We continued discussing on Monday through Skype the future of MU and how can we improve our current activities. You can find a except of what happened in [The Big Picture](http://mendicantuniversity.org/updates/2012/07/11/the-big-picture.html). The article was also posted in the mailing list and some discussion is starting there. All comments are really appreciated.

* [Mentoring forum](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/categories/requests-for-mentoring-code-reviews) is starting to move a little bit. We have now some requests for mentoring and some interesting discussions. If you are interested in mentoring or being mentored, please, drop by.

* We are posting this week's issue of The Unicorn's Horn to the mailing list. If you believe we forgot something or want something to appear in it. Please, tell us so.

* Jordan Byron held office hours in our IRC channel #mendicant. He had some work and you can review [Anita's logs](http://anita.mendicantuniversity.org/mendicant/20120711..20120712) to check what happened there.

#### Upcoming Plans:

* Summer has affected us all and we have almost no activities but Rafa de Castro will have [office hours](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/07/18/office-hours-with-rafa-de-castro.html) on Wednesday from 18:00 to 19:30 UTC.
